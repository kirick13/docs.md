# docs.md docs

`docs.md` is a simple documentation generator based on Markdown and EJS.

Just create some markdown files, launch our lightning-fast compiler and server compiled HTML files by any web-server, even by Python's `http.server`.

Extend your `.md` files using [EJS syntax](https://ejs.co) such as `import()` to include other `.md` files.

To get started, visit [Getting started](/getting-started.html) page.
