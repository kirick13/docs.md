# docs.md

`docs.md` is a simple documentation generator based on Markdown and EJS.

Just create some markdown files, launch compiler and serve compiled HTML files by any web-server, even by Python's `http.server`.

Extend your `.md` files using [EJS syntax](https://ejs.co) such as `import()` to include other `.md` files.

Resulting HTML pages are extremely fast and lightweight. There are only few lines of Javascript code. No reactivity. No frameworks. Just HTML and CSS.

To get started, visit [Getting started](/getting-started.html) page.
