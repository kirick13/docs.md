# Roadmap

## Features

- Add nested "Parameters" blocks.
- Think about setting a base for the website (for example, use `<base>` element?).
- Add some JavaScript code to detect if `:has()` pseudo-class is supported by the browser.
  - If not, load JavaScript code to replace this functionality.

## Compiler

- Publish an NPM package to allow compilation without Docker.

## UI

- Add copy button to code blocks.
